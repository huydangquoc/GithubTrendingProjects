# GitHub Trending Projects

This is an evaluation project that tries to identify the coding compatibility with the team. Try to code as clean and clear as possible, taking into account reusability and legibility is more important than high performance. Having a great and polished design is not the goal of this project.

The main idea of the project is to list trending projects on Github and when tap on one of them, show their details. The design of the project is attached to the email.

**Requirements** for the project

- MVVM- Swift 3.2 or later
- ReactiveCocoa 6.0+ (Nice to have)

**NOTE**: Please create a git repository for the example (simulate that it's a real project).
If there is something not specified, please be free to take the decision on it and explain it in your Readme.
